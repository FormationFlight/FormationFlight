# FormationFlight  

[![Build](https://github.com/FormationFlight/FormationFlight/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FormationFlight/FormationFlight/actions/workflows/build.yml)

FormationFlight provides FPV pilots with inter-UAS positioning & telemetry enabling formation flights, chase footage, and ground station coordination with ease. Spiritual successor to the [iNav Radar](https://github.com/OlivierC-FR/ESP32-INAV-Radar) project, FormationFlight adds many improvements including faster update rates, more users, encryption, and smaller, lighter hardware originally developed for the [ExpressLRS project](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS).

## Discord

We use the [FormationFlight Discord](https://discord.gg/s6vEaN3Ucj) to discuss project development & support new users. 

## Development Information

### Builds:
We run [automated builds on GitHub actions](https://github.com/FormationFlight/FormationFlight/actions) against the master branch and upload artifacts of all built targets as a zip file.

### Building manually:
Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO is required; all dependencies are managed by PlatformIO so it should be as simple as installing VSCode, installing PlatformIO, cloning the repo, and building! If you have any questions, please join our Discord and ask around.
